A Virtual Machine using an emulated 6502.
This is a personal educational project that will serve as the foundation for understanding the relationship between software and hardware. This project will include
- an emulated 6502
- emulated bus
- virtual devices that will connect to this bus
- virtual memory as a device
- pre-made video device
- pre-made keyboard capture device
- support for custom devices and a simple interface for such
- a basic OS to interact with the VM

As this project is built upon it will eventually become a full-blown system and include a C library for OS programming. Any 6502 CXX should be capable of compiling ELF binaries. OS will eventually be UNIX based.
